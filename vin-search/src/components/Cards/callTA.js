        Welcome to Neural Claim System, (NCS). NCS is a global leading, AI/Machine Learning platform which categorizes glass damage. This patented process allows insurance carriers and glass vendors the ability to submit a series of photos through the platform which will disposition the damage and determine what type of work needs to be performed. After dispositioning the damage, the NCS platform will select the proper parts needed and indicate if ADAS calibration is required. In the U.S., dispositioning of the damage is performed based on ROLAGS standards.
